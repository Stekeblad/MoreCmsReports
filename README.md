# MoreCmsReports
### Adds more reports to EPiServer

## This project is in early development

### Still want to test it?

Here is some quick info how:

- Currently targets EPiServer.CMS.UI.Core >= 11.0.0.0 and < 12.0.0.0 (but only tested against 11.21.5)
- The nugget package can be found in the nuget folder
- The report data is generated by the scheduled job GenerateMoreCmsReportsData
	- The data is saved to the configured App_Data directory, make sure the website can read and write to that directory
- Only the report InaccessibleContentReport have view and data collection implemented
	- It lists pages, blocks, images and ther content that is not accessible to site visitors or have no content instances in the database
	- It needs some CSS but the data is there
	- You can view the report in the report center after running the scheduled job
